## Python Basic
---
* local variables
In Python, we don't have block level scope. No matter we define a variable in a function,
it is always **accessible** in that function after it is defined. So it is about *local variables*.
```python
def greet():
    if True:
        message = "Hi, the beautiful world!"
    print(message)
```
* global variables


## Data Structures

Here is 

```python
print("hello world!")
```
